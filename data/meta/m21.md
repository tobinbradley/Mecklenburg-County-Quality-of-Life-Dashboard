## Proximity to Early Care and Education
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a licensed early care and education program for children birth to age 5

### Why is this important?
Early care and education programs support working families and provide young children with the strong foundation they need to enter school prepared to thrive. Substantial research demonstrates that accessible, high quality early care positively affects children's growth, physical health, cognitive, social and emotional development, and later school success. Proximity to care is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are program cost, availability of financial assistance, program capacity, hours of operation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.

#### How are we doing?
In 2015, approximately 65% of housing units had proximity to early care and education. While the number of child care centers has remained relatively constant over time, the number and capacity of family child care homes has declined steadily over the last five years.

#### Did you know?
The average annual cost for center-based early care and education in Mecklenburg County is $10,556, an estimated 20% of the living income standard for a family of three. On average, 7,339 children received financial assistance for child care in 2014, but another 4,694 eligible children were on the waiting list for financial assistance.
