## Residential Foreclosures
Number of residential foreclosures per Voting Precinct.

### Why is this important?
A high number of foreclosures in an area can indicate high levels of poverty, joblessness, and general neighborhood neglect. Foreclosures create abandoned properties, which are a blight on a community and can signal increases in crime.

### About the Data
