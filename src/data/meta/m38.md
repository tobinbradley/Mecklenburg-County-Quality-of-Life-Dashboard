## Employment
Percentage of adults in the labor force who are employed

### Why is this important?
Employment is the key driver to economies on all scales. Residents with stable employment and sufficient income are able to support themselves, their families, and the local economy. A high employment rate means that the economy is strong enough to provide jobs for everyone who can work. The employment rate may also measure how well, or how poorly, the skills of the workforce match the available jobs in the region. On a neighborhood scale, high rates of employment create more job opportunities for people looking for work, and may thus help communities be more resilient to changes in the economy.

####How are we doing?
The 2013 annual unemployment rate for Charlotte was 7.1% compared to 8.0% in Mecklenburg County, 8.0% statewide, and 7.4% nationally. Following a peak of 11.1% in 2010, the annual unemployment rate in Mecklenburg County declined steadily through 2013, and dropped significantly throughout 2014. As of October 2014, unemployment had fallen to 4.9% in Charlotte, 5.7% in Mecklenburg County, and 5.5% both statewide and nationally. 

####Did you know?
Employment rates tell only part of the employment story, as they do not take underemployment into account. Underemployment is when a person is employed, but not to a sufficient standard, and can include working only part-time hours when full-time work is desired, not being eligible for health or other benefits, or being overqualified for a job. The national underemployment rate in 2013 was 13.8%.

### About the Data 
Number of individuals ages 16 to 64 in the civilian labor force and employed divided by the number of individuals ages 16 to 64 in the civilian labor force. The employment rate, rather than the unemployment rate, is calculated because figures for unemployment at the neighborhood scale are statistically unreliable. This is because relatively small numbers of people are unemployed versus employed, and it is generally difficult to generate reliable estimates for small populations from sample surveys like the American Community Survey.
