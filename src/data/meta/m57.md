## Age of Death
Average age of death

### Why is this important?
Average age of death is a measure of the quality of health and life in a community. A number of factors contribute to average age of death including economic status and educational attainment, access to quality health care, individual health behaviors, exposure to violence and crime, traffic safety conditions, and general rates of disease. Overall health and age of death may also be impacted by characteristics of the built environment such as exposure to environmental hazards, lack of access to healthy food, and few opportunities for safe physical activity. 

####How are we doing?
In 2012 and 2013, there were 5,474 deaths in Mecklenburg County and the average age of death was 71. In general, average age of death is increasing, though at a neighborhood scale, average age of death may vary greatly over short periods of time.
