## Population Density
Concentration of residents

### Why is this important?
Trends in population show where the community is growing and where it is declining, which can help government agencies and service providers identify where infrastructure, services, and investment may be needed. Higher population density decreases cost of infrastructure such as roads and utilities, and increases efficiency of service delivery such as police, fire and emergency services. Greater population density in a neighborhood can support the availability of local retail options, schools and transit. On a regional scale, population density can yield economic benefits through higher labor productivity, enhanced innovation, and higher income growth.

####How are we doing?
To compare density across metropolitan areas, demographers use population-weighted density, a measure which counts the density around each person and averages it over all the residents in an area. The Charlotte region is a comparatively low-density region. As of the 2010 Census, the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill metro area ranked 32nd out of the top 50 metro areas in total population (1.76 million people), but just 47th in population-weighted density (1,881 people per square mile). On the other hand, the greater Charlotte region is quickly becoming more dense: up 143 people per square mile in population-weighted density since 2000, ranking seventh overall in density growth.

####Did you know?
The North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management projects that Mecklenburg County will grow to a population of more than **1.4 million** residents in 2034 - a 40% increase expected in just 20 years. Population projections from the United Nations show Charlotte and Raleigh as the fastest growing U.S. cities from 2010 to 2030.
