## Sidewalk Availability
Percentage of paved streets that have sidewalks

### Why is this important?
Environments that support walking - both as an alternative to driving and as a leisure activity - have positive health, economic, and environmental benefits. Sidewalks can offer safe routes to school for children and allow residents to safely access nearby employment, parks, shopping areas, transit stops, and other destinations. Streets without sidewalks are more likely to have pedestrian crashes than those with sidewalks on both sides of the street. Sidewalks separated from the street by a generous planting strip with street trees create the preferred pedestrian environment in most situations. 

####How are we doing?
There are over 2,400 miles of streets with adjacent sidewalks in Mecklenburg County, representing 44% of all paved streets. The City of Charlotte has a goal of constructing 375 miles of new sidewalks by 2035. 

Mecklenburg County's legacy of auto-oriented development continues to present significant challenges for pedestrian mobility. In 2013, 2.2% of people in Charlotte reported commuting to work regularly by walking, similar to Raleigh, NC (2.0%), but lower than Atlanta, GA (4.5%). Charlotte was ranked 31 out of 52 of the nation's largest cities with Boston, MA topping the list at 15.0%. 

####Did you know?
Annually, approximately 4,500 pedestrians are killed in traffic crashes with motor vehicles in the United States. According to the Alliance for Biking and Walking, there are on average 17 pedestrian fatalities per year in Charlotte, similar to the average for all large cities.

### About the Data
The length of paved street with sidewalk on at least one side divided by the total length of paved streets. Sidewalks not adjacent to public streets and unpaved walking trails are not included. This measure does not account for physical obstructions that would impair an individual's ability to access the location or amenity. The quality of the sidewalk is also not assessed. Due to improved precision and changes in how this variable is calculated, data from prior years is not comparable to 2013 and forward.
