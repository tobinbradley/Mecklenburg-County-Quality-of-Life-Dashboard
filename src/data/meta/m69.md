## Residential Foreclosures
Percentage of dwellings that were foreclosed on

### Why is this important?
Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods and cities and can be destabilizing for neighborhoods and families. Homes that are foreclosed on and are not sold or otherwise re-occupied can result in vacancies, economic disinvestment, and physical deterioration. Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area may affect property values, tax receipts and public service delivery, vandalism and crime rates, and social cohesion. People and families, too, are impacted by foreclosures, as the loss of a home, whether owned or rented, can lead to displacement, stress, and more financial strain. 

####How are we doing?
The number of foreclosures in Mecklenburg County dropped 15% from 2010 to 2012.
