## Education - Bachelor's Degree
Percentage of adults over age 25 with a Bachelor's degree or higher

### Why is this important?
Adult education levels are closely related to individual economic opportunity, financial stability, and even health. Education levels are also a factor in business location and expansion decisions, as they indicate both the qualifications of the workforce and the potential market for certain goods and services. Educational attainment varies widely by age, family income, and race and ethnicity. At the neighborhood level, differences in educational attainment can persist across generations, as children living in neighborhoods with high adult educational attainment tend to have greater exposure to the world of work and higher expectations for their own education and employment prospects.

####How are we doing?
The percentage of adults in Mecklenburg County with a bachelor's degree was 41.9% in 2013, and has remained virtually unchanged over the last 7 years. Typical of urban areas, Mecklenburg County's percentage is significantly higher than North Carolina (28.4%) and the United States (29.6%). However, in a 2012 study, the Charlotte metro region ranked 28th among large metro areas in the share of adults with a bachelor's degree at 32.2%, trailing other metro areas in the region including the Raleigh, NC metro (ranked 7th at 41.0%) and the Atlanta, GA metro (ranked 16th at 34.1%).

####Did you know?
The unemployment rate drops significantly for each level of education attained. In 2013, the unemployment rate in Mecklenburg County for adults over 25 was: 14.0% for those without a high school diploma; 8.8% for those with an Associate's degree; and 3.8% for those with a Bachelor's degree or higher.
