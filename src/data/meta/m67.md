## Neighborhood School Attendance 
Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students attending their home school

### Why is this important?
Access to quality schools is important to family and neighborhood health. A strong connection between a neighborhood and its school can improve student outcomes, create a more positive school environment, increase safety and community pride, and promote neighborhood stability and desirability. In addition to education, a school building can serve as an important place of social connection in a neighborhood, and, by leveraging community partnerships, can be a place to access other services for students and families. Attending neighborhood schools can reduce transportation costs for school systems and families, while promoting health by enabling students to walk or bike to school. School choice can be influenced by many factors including preference for special programming/area of focus offered elsewhere, school proximity to home or work, sibling attendance, transportation, school academic reputation, availability of afterschool programming or childcare, neighborhood safety, and others.

####How are we doing?
Overall, the percentage of students attending assigned neighborhood schools increased from 76% in 2010-11 to 82% in 2012-13. Many factors may have contributed to this change including increases in school options available at neighborhood schools, strengthened neighborhood-school partnerships, and availability of school choice transportation. 

####Did you know?
Approximately 85% of school-age students in Mecklenburg County are enrolled in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), a total of 141,171 students in 2012-13. CMS has a goal of providing every family and student at least two high-quality school options. In addition to neighborhood schools, CMS offers magnet programs, career academies, early and middle colleges, and other distinctive school models, some of which are offered within the neighborhood school. School options are accessed using the district's school options lottery process.
