## Proximity to Financial Services
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a bank or credit union

### Why is this important?
Financial services, such as basic checking and savings accounts, are foundations for financial security. In addition, access to affordable, healthy credit and freedom from high-interest loans are essential for community health. Banks and credit unions provide financial services to businesses and individuals, and, while there are fees and other costs associated with these services, they are regulated and insured by government agencies. When physical, financial or other barriers exist to accessing services through banks and credit unions, people often rely on alternative financial services such as check cashing outlets, payday lenders, and pawn shops. While these providers offer convenient services and easy access to cash, their services often carry high costs, limiting families' abilities to accumulate assets and establish a credit history. 

#### How are we doing?
In 2015, 32% of housing units were within &#189;-mile of a bank or credit union. There are 309 banks and credit unions inside Mecklenburg County, up from 300 in 2014. However, large areas of the county do not have a bank or credit union nearby - 157 Neighborhood Profile Areas, totaling 121,028 housing units, did not have any housing units in proximity to a bank or credit union.

#### Did you know?
In Mecklenburg County, 8.1% of households are unbanked (do not have a bank account at an insured institution) in 2013, and another 33.8% were underbanked (had a bank account but also used an alternative financial service). According to an FDIC survey, reasons for unbanked households include not having enough money, not trusting banks, and account fees that are too high.
