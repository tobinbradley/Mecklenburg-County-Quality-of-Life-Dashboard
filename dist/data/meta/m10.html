<p>Percentage of workers who commute by driving alone </p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Commuting to and from work constitutes approximately 30% of household-related vehicle miles travelled, and driving alone is the least energy-efficient commuting mode. In addition to conserving resources, reducing the number of commuters driving alone can reduce road congestion, lower the likelihood of traffic accidents, improve air quality and public health, reduce land used for parking in job centers, and reduce transportation costs for households. </p>
<p>The use of alternative commuting modes - carpool, public transit, walking and biking - is dependent on the mix of land uses in an area, proximity to transit stops and convenience of routes, and availability of sidewalks, trails and bike lanes. Understanding commuting patterns can guide transportation strategies and help identify needed infrastructure improvements to support alternative commuting modes.</p>
<p>####How are we doing?
The percentage of Mecklenburg County workers who drive alone to and from work has remained relatively stable over time, even with an increase in transportation options and improved bike and pedestrian infrastructure. In 2013, 77% of workers in Mecklenburg County commuted by driving alone, on par with the national (76%) and slightly lower than the state (81%) percentages, but much higher than some other major metropolitan areas including Seattle, Washington, Boston, San Francisco and New York, all with drive-alone shares under 70%.</p>
<p>Note: The values for Mecklenburg County used in the previous paragraph are from the American Community Survey 2013 1-Year estimates, which provide the most current and reliable estimates at the county level. These values may differ from the county value displayed on the dashboard, which is calculated from the NPA values using the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/">Click here</a> to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.</p>
<p>####Did you know?
These data only include workers who commute from within Mecklenburg County. There are an additional 180,000 people that commute from surrounding counties to work in Mecklenburg each day, most coming from Union County (37,000), closely followed by York (29,000), Cabarrus (29,000), and Gaston (26,000). </p>
