<p>The median age - where half the population is older and half the population is younger - reflects demographic trends and may provide an indication of needed resources and services. On the neighborhood scale, median age can be rapidly affected by births, deaths and migration. A falling median age may signal the influx of younger people or the growth of families. A rising median age may signal the departure of younger people to other areas or the aging in place of the population. Understanding demographic trends helps in planning for housing, health care services, schools and out-of-school time programs, and employment services. </p>

<p>The median age in Mecklenburg County is 34.2, compared to 37.8 in North Carolina and 37.4 in the United States. While the nation as a whole is rapidly getting older, the median age in Mecklenburg has risen only marginally, due to growing families, high levels of international migration, increasing university enrollment, and attraction of young professionals to the area.</p>
